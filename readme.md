I'm currently a third year PhD student in the school of engineering at Cardiff University. I have been developing robot learning techniques for grasping and manipulation, supervised by Dr Ze Ji, Dr Yukun Lai, and Dr Jing Wu. My knowledge in machine learning (especially reinforcement learning) and experience in programming (Python, ROS, C++) have enabled me to make theoretic discoveries and conduct practical software design and experiments. I also devote myself to open-sourced software development. I remains active in various academic activities throughout the pandemic (online and in-person conferences).

Take a look around, drop me an email if you like.
